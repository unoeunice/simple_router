Overall the code looks pretty good and works well. I found it a bit interesting you decided to use loaders for some of the pages but not all of them. I would recommend using loaders for all of them or none of them to make your app more consistent. This would also make the loading spinner much easier to manage.

I also noticed you used the loader for some pages,
 but then still did an axios fetch request in the component to get more data. 
 You should be doing all the data loading in the loader if at all possible to again simplify your code.

Lastly, I would recommend adding a bit more folder structure to your code by moving the non-page based files out of the pages folder and into a separate components folder. This can make the code a bit easier to read.

Other than that it looks quite good.
